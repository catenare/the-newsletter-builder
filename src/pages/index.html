            <p>Despite the tough economic situation, we've had additions to the school over the months. We are thankful that the school has been consistent and we are able to keep our staff on board.  We are currently preparing the children for their Spring Concert (September) and looking forward to their growth.</p>

            <h4>Church News</h4>
            <p>Our church attendance usually drops during the winter months due to the cold weather. But we praise the Lord that we have seen just the opposite. There have been quite a few new faces in the congregation and the rise in attendance has truly been encouraging.</p>
            <p>We celebrated Mother’s and Father’s day during May and June.  Chris made sure that, as a church, we acknowledged these days as in South Africa it is not everyone that acknowledges the roles played by mothers and fathers.  I was very glad to see that the “tradition” did not end with him. Our men and women of the church went out of their way to make sure that every mother and father was spoiled on their respective days.</p>
            <p>We recentely started with a young people’s praise and worship team. This lets our young people become more involved in the Sunday service. Six young people have been consistent in attending for the past 2 months.  We are trusting the Lord that, as they participate in the service, they also grow an attitude of commitment to the Lord and to the church.</p>
            <p>We thank the Lord for the new leaders of our Marriage Enrichment group.  Nolan and Judy Billings have been with the church for a while and they had their first meeting during the last week of June.

            <h4>Family News</h4>
            <p>I thank the Lord for my son, who has stayed for the past 11 months to help wrap up Chris' estate and provide support with the school.  He is preparing to go back to the States and I know that it will be another adjustment. But I thank the Lord that he was able to be here as a support to me and the rest of the family.
</p>
            <p>It seems as the year is flying by.  We are soon approaching the one year mark of Chris’ going home.  As a family, we miss Chris in the small things such as Mothers and Father’s day, birthdays and the Sunday lunches.  There is a massive void that is felt by his absence.  At times it feels as if the family is battling to come to a place of acceptance which creates stress between the individual members.  Please continue to keep us in prayer.  
</p>
            <p>Once again thank you all for your financial support, prayers and words of encouragement.  May the Lord bless you as you continue to serve Him.</p>
