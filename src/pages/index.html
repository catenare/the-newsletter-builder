            <h4>Dear Praying Friends,</h4>

            <p>These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye
                shall have tribulation: be of good cheer; I have overcome world John 16:33</p>
            <p>We have so much to be thankful for.</p>
            <p>The week after Hadessah's funeral we had 30 children in the Sunday School! Many of
                the children previously attended the Preschool and Daycare and others were
                neighborhood kids who were reached during Vacation Bible School. On the same Sunday,
                we had two ladies rededicate their lives to the Lord and a young gentleman who
                accepted the Lord as his personal savior. Since his acceptance of the Lord Jesus
                Christ, he has attended services regularly. This is such an encouragement to us.</p>

            <h4>Church</h4>
        </row>
        <row>
            <p>Following all our unexpected events, we finally had our church planning meeting for
                2017. Our aim is to grow the church so that we are in the position to call a pastor
                full time. Our first endeavor towards growth will be the weekend of 19 February
                2017, where we will do a door to door drive in handing out information regarding the
                church to the people in the neighborhood. We would like everyone in Klipspruit to
                know of Paseo Baptist Church.</p>
            <p>With Chris and Hadessah having been such hard working and active members in the
                church, we are finding that there are new opportunities for others to step forward
                and take leadership positions. Due to the "big shoes" they left, it appears that the
                positions are intimidating to others, but we know that the Lord will raise up
                leaders that will fulfill the necessary positions. Our two biggest concerns are
                finding someone in the interim to do the preaching and a youth leader.</p>

            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>Please continue to pray for Hadessah's family. Her husband Derrick, has been faithful
                in preaching weekly, however he has decided that he needs some time off from the
                preaching roster to help support his children and start the healing process in his
                own life. Hadessah left behind 4 children who are battling to find their way after
                their mothers' death. Please keep them in your prayers. As we have stated earlier,
                we might have tribulations, but we know that the Lord has overcome the world.</p>
            <p>On a personal note, I'm still taking things one day at a time. The Lord is faithful
                in keeping me in good health and giving me strength for each new day. I've been so
                blessed to receive notification from two of my supporting churches that they will
                continue to support me for the 2017 year of which I can only give God all the honor
                and praise for.</p>

            <p>Once again, thank you to all of you who continue to pray for the work here in South
                Africa and myself. It is through your prayers and financial contribution to the
                ministry that others can be reached for Christ.</p>
