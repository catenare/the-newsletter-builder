            <h4>Hadessah</h4>
            <row>
            <p>Hadessah Jones, my daughter, passed away on 3 January, 2017 at 11:50PM. On 28 December 2016, after showing signs of progress and recognizing the people around her, she was transferred to a rehabilitation center after being in intensive care for over four months. We were hopeful that she would return home after a short time at the rehabilitation facility.  However, on January 3, 2017, at the center, she passed to glory. This has been very difficult for us as a family, especially so soon after Chris’ death, but we know what the Lord has done is best.</p>
            <p>Besides being my daughter, Hadessah was also very active in our church with her husband, Derrick. She started and maintained the choir, youth and marriage enrichment ministries. Hadessah also worked with me at the pre-school and day-care center where she did the administration and taught a class. Many of the young people and parents that Hadessah had reached were at her funeral. Our grief is shared with everyone she has influenced and she will be truly missed.</p>

            <h4>Preschool and Daycare</h4>
            <p>The Daycare and Preschool reopened on the 11 January with fewer children then what we had last year. Our goal is to increase enrollment to at least 100 students by the end of February. We are trusting the Lord to increase our attendance to ensure we can keep our existing teachers and support staff. Keep us in your prayers as we work towards this goal. </p>

            <h4>Church</h4>
            <columns small="12" large="12">
                <p>With my daughter’s funeral, it feels as if the church is experiencing another “setback” without having fully recovered from the passing of my husband.  Derrick Jones, my son in law and ordained pastor, is still doing the preaching and the men are still active in the leadership roles of the church.  However, as we start the planning for the new year there are ministries & responsibilities that are vacant. Please pray with us that these will be filled with men and woman who carry the burden for souls to be saved in Klipspruit West. My goal for this year is to help increase our church membership by leveraging our day-care and pre-school ministry.</p>

            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>The last 5 months has been a very trying time for me.  I am fortunate that my son, Johan, is still with me and is assisting with the administration of the school and the finalization of Chris’s estate.  However, there have been moments that I was unsure and in these times, the prayers and encouragement from fellow believers have given me the motivation to go on. Even when I would question the events of the past 5 months the Lord has shown me that His grace is sufficient and His mercies are new every day.</p>

            <p>In the January newsletter from Angus Buchan, he encourages us as believers with 1 Samuel 7:12 which says “Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenenzer, saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”</p>
            <p>Thank you for allowing the Lord to let you be a part of the ministry here in Klipspruit-West, South Africa.   Your financial contributions and prayers for the work here are truly making a difference in the lives of others. </p>
