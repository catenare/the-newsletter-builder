            <h4>Dear Friends,</h4>
            <p>As I’m writing this letter, I’m reflecting back on this time last year (2016).  December is when Chris and I celebrated our wedding anniversary (which would have been our 50th this year) and also Chris’ birthday (which is Christmas day). Last year was a very emotional time for us as a family during this time. But we were anxious for 2017, because we believed that the New Year would be better.  We could start dealing with Chris’ passing and we believed that my eldest daughter, Hadessah, would recover from her stroke.  However, the year began with Hadessah passing away on 3 January.  It seemed to set the tone for months that followed.  2017 was a year of great personal loss including the death of my eldest brother, Norman Hendriks.  But as the Word of God declares, <blockquote>"But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold." <cite>Job 23:10</cite></blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>We still feel the immense losses of 2016 & 2017 while we are getting ready for Christmas, but I am also excited to celebrate the remembrance of our Savior’s birth. <blockquote>"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." <cite>Isaiah 9:6</cite></blockquote>

            <p>We had our Preschool graduation at the beginning of the December where we celebrated our 18 youngsters getting promoted to the first grade. It was both a happy and a sad occasion. Some of our youngsters have been with us for over 4 years. But it was also a special occasion for the children and their families to celebrate their achievement and to see the excitement in the children’s eyes knowing that they’re going to the “big school” next year.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, one of our daycare children, Kiara Claasen, passed away at the end of November. She had surgery to rectify a heart condition but there were complications. It was only a couple of weeks before her 5th birthday and her loss was deeply felt by everyone at the daycare center. One of my memories I have of her was, when I asked the children during assembly if everyone was going to heaven, she confidently answered, <cite>“No teacher, you must have Jesus in your heart”</cite>.

            <h4>Church News</h4>
            <p>The church is still progressing.  We are seeing different faces and we are trusting the Lord that they will make a decision to commit their lives fully to Christ.  Schools and companies close during this time of the year so many of our families are away on a family holiday.  Keep them in your prayers and we trust the Lord that they will travel safely.</p>
            <p>Our church leadership team is excited about the new year and we are looking forward to what the Lord has in store for our congregation. We have already started planning our evangelism drive and cannot wait to see what the Lord will do for us.</p>
