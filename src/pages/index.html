            <p>We are working in a community facing many challenges especially related to crime. In
                our prayer meeting last week we spoke about the crime and drug abuse in Klipspruit
                West and surrounding areas. Lionel Billings, one of our members, had his car stolen.
                There were stories of drug abuse by both old and young people and house
                burglaries are rampant. During these times, we can become so overwhelmed,
                but I am reminded of a preacher who said, “The Lord sent us to fish and not to clean
                the pond.”</p>

            <p>Over the months we have had additions to the school.  Despite the tough economic situation, we are thankful that the school has been consistent and we are able to keep our staff on board.  We are currently preparing the children for their Spring Concert and looking forward to their growth.

            <h4>Church News</h4>
            <p>Usually during the winter months, our attendance drops due to the cold weather, but we praise the Lord that we have seen just the opposite.  There have been quite a few new faces in the congregation and the rise in attendance has truly been an encouragement.</p>
            <p>During May and June, we celebrated Mother’s and Father’s day.  Chis made sure that as a church we acknowledged these days as in South Africa it is not everyone that acknowledges the roles played by mothers and fathers.  I was very glad to see that the “tradition” did not end with him as our men and women of the church went out of their way to make sure that every mother and father was spoiled respectively.</p>
            <p>Recently we have started with a young people’s praise and worship team as a means to involve the young people in the Sunday service.  We currently have 6 young people who have been consistent in attending for the past 2 months.  We are trusting the Lord that as they participate in the service that they also grow an attitude of commitment to the Lord and their local church.</p>
            <p>We thank the Lord that leaders emerged for the Marriage Enrichment department.  A couple that has been with the church for a while availed themselves and they had their first meeting this week.

            <h4>Family News</h4>
            <p>I thank the Lord for my son, who has stayed for the past 11 months to help me resolve issues around the estate, and been a support with the school.  As he is preparing to go back to the States, I know that it will be another adjustment, but I thank the Lord that he was able to be here with me and a support to the rest of the family during this time
</p>
            <p>It seems as the year is flying by we are soon approaching the one year mark of Chris’ home going.  As a family, we miss Chris in the small things such as Mothers and Father’s day, birthdays and the Sunday lunches.  There is a massive void that is felt by his absence.  At times it feels as if the family is battling to come to a place of acceptance which creates stress between the individual members.  Please continue to keep us in prayer.  
</p>
            <p>Once again thank you all for your financial support, prayers and words of encouragement.  May the Lord bless you as you continue to serve Him.</p>

            <p>Trusting you will have a blessed Easter as we remember our Savior’s death, and
                celebrate His resurrection.</p>
