            <blockquote>“And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth.”&nbsp;

               Spring is almost here in South Africa.  There is still a chill in the air but the spring flowers are starting to bloom.  It's an exciting time as we watch the change from winter season to spring.

            <h4>Church News</h4>
            <p>
                Although our church building can be cold at, we enjoyed good, consistent attendance at our Sunday morning services.  In our prior newsletter, we asked you to pray with us for a Youth Sunday School teacher. We thank the Lord it has been answered.  We have a group of about eight young people who are active and faithful in attending our services, Sunday school and youth meetings.  Our desire now is for more adults to attend our Sunday morning Bible study class.</p>
                <p>
                We are still in need of a full-time Pastor at the church. We pray that the Lord will send someone who will share in our vision of seeing the local community come to Christ.  Pastor Bennet is still assisting us in the meantime until this need is met.

            <h4>Preschool and Daycare</h4>
            <p>The children are getting ready for our annual spring concert. They are rehearsing the poems, songs and scripture verses they have learned through the year. These will be presented to the parents at the concert. We thank the Lord that our enrollment has remained consistent despite the difficult economic times in South Africa.</p>

            <p>
                    My brother, Norman Hendriks, was attacked three weeks ago during a robbery in his home. Norman is 73 years old and was stabbed 11 times.  He is still in the Intensive Care Unit after undergoing surgery. Because of complications, he is currently sedated and not able to breath on his own. This is a reminder of our experience with Hadessah when she was sedated, in Intensive Care and unable to breath on her own. All of this is happening at the same time we are remembering the loss of Chris last year.
            </p>
            <p>  
                    Please pray with me for the following:
                    <ul>
                    <li>for my brother’s health and his family as they are coping with the uncertainty and grief</li>
                    <li>for myself, that the Lord will strengthen me during this time</li>
                    <li>for my grandchildren as they are struggling to adapt to the loss of their mom</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Once again thank you all for your financial support, prayers and words of encouragement.  May the Lord bless you as you continue to serve Him.</p>
